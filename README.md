## ðŸ“˜ Work Completed  

### **Day 1 â€“ C Language Refresher**  
- Implemented syntax, operators, control structures, functions, arrays, strings, enums, structures, and file I/O basics.  

### **Day 2 â€“ Advanced C**  
- Completed exercises on pointers, memory allocation, linked lists, preprocessor directives, and file I/O.  

### **Day 3 â€“ Linux Shell, Makefile & Git**  
- Wrote multiple shell scripts (loops, conditionals, arrays, file ops).  
- Created Makefiles (simple + advanced project automation).  
- Practiced Git workflows (branching, merging, stash, tags).  
- Backup/archive tasks using tar & logs.  

### **Day 5 â€“ RISC-V ISA & Spike**  
- Installed Spike + RISC-V toolchain.  
- Compiled and executed assembly programs.  
- Implemented restoring and non-restoring division algorithms in C and assembly.  
- Verified outputs with Spike simulator.
